/// which represents the data that it is protecting. The data can only be accessed
/// through the RAII guards returned from [`lock`] and [`try_lock`], which
/// guarantees that the data is only ever accessed when the mutex is locked.

/// use sayuri::sync::Mutex;
///
/// const N: usize = 10;
///
/// // Spawn a few threads to increment a shared variable (non-atomically), and
/// // let the main thread know once all increments are done.
/// //
/// // Here we're using an Arc to share memory among threads, and the data inside
/// // the Arc is protected with a mutex.
/// let data = Arc::new(Mutex::new(0));
///
/// let (tx, rx) = channel();
/// for _ in 0..N {
///     let (data, tx) = (Arc::clone(&data), tx.clone());
///     thread::spawn(move || {
///         // The shared state can only be accessed once the lock is held.
///         // Our non-atomic increment is safe because we're the only thread
///         // which can access the shared state when the lock is held.
///         let mut data = data.lock();
///         *data += 1;
